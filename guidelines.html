<h1>AGREED - Agile Risk Management Model</h1>
<h2>Guidelines</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Familiarize Yourself with the Cards:</strong> Before you dive into
    integrating the cards, take some time to familiarize yourself with their
    content. Each Essence Card encapsulates a specific aspect of risk management
    within an agile context. Understand the information and insights provided on
    each card to grasp their potential applications.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Align Cards with Your Risk Management Process:</strong> Review your
    existing risk management process and identify key stages or activities where
    the Essence Cards can enhance your approach. Match each card to the relevant
    phase of your risk management lifecycle, whether it's risk identification,
    analysis, assessment, or control.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Contextualize Agile Principles:</strong> One of the strengths of
    Essence Cards is their agility-focused approach. As you integrate the cards,
    ensure that you align their guidance with agile principles such as
    collaboration, adaptability, and continuous improvement. Tailor your risk
    management strategies to fit seamlessly into your agile projects.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Use Cards for Decision-Making:</strong> When you encounter a
    specific risk-related decision point, consult the corresponding Essence
    Card. These cards provide actionable insights, strategies, and practical
    examples that can guide your decision-making process. By referencing the
    cards, you'll be equipped to make informed choices that align with your
    project's agile goals.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Enhance Communication and Collaboration:</strong> Essence Cards also
    serve as communication tools. Share relevant cards with your team members
    during discussions, workshops, or agile ceremonies. The visual nature of the
    cards can facilitate clearer communication and foster collaboration among
    team members.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Continuous Learning and Improvement:</strong> Integrate the Essence
    Cards into your team's learning culture. Regularly review and discuss the
    cards as part of retrospectives, knowledge-sharing sessions, or agile
    training initiatives. Encourage team members to contribute their insights
    and experiences, enriching the understanding of risk management within an
    agile context.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Combine with Existing Tools:</strong> If you already have a
    well-defined risk management process/tool, Essence Cards can seamlessly
    complement your existing risk management tools, whether they are digital
    platforms or physical artifacts. You can incorporate the cards into your
    documentation or risk management software to enhance and reinforce
    agile-oriented risk management practices.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Iterate and Adapt:</strong> Just as agile principles emphasize
    iteration and adaptation, be prepared to iterate your approach to
    integrating Essence Cards. Continuously assess the effectiveness of using
    the cards, gather feedback from your team, and make adjustments as needed to
    ensure optimal outcomes.
  </li>
</ol>
